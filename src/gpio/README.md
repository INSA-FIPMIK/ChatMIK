# PWM configuration
Before using PWMs pins they must be configured on the board using this command directly on the jetson nano:
```sudo /opt/nvidia/jetson-io/jetson-io.py```
then go to Configure Jetson 40pin Header/Configure header pins manually and check the boxes for pwm pins (32, 33) then save, exit and reboot
